# About Me

I'm a frontend developer with over 5 years of experience building web applications. My journey started with simple HTML and CSS, and has evolved into creating complex, scalable applications using modern JavaScript frameworks.

## My Journey

I discovered my passion for web development during university, where I studied Computer Science. Since then, I've worked on various projects ranging from small business websites to large-scale enterprise applications.

## Experience

- **Senior Frontend Developer** at TechCorp (2021-Present)
- **Frontend Developer** at WebStudio (2019-2021)
- **Junior Developer** at StartupXYZ (2018-2019)

## Education

- **Bachelor of Computer Science** - University of Technology (2014-2018)

## What Drives Me

I believe in creating web experiences that are not just functional, but delightful to use. Every project is an opportunity to learn something new and push the boundaries of what's possible on the web.
